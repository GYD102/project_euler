Problem:
--------
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.


Analysis:
---------
Let s_i be the set of all multiples of 3 or 5 that are < i.
Let S_i be the sum of all elements in set s_i
s_1 = {} = s_2 = s_3; 	    S_1 = 0
s_4 = {3} = s_5; 	    S_4 = 3
s_6 = {3,5};		    S_6 = 8
s_7 = {3,5,6} = s_8 = s_9;  S_7 = 14

Goal: Find S_1000. 

sum(s_m) = sum(s_n) + sum(s_m \ s_n)

where m > n and s_m \ s_n is the set difference between s_m and s_n.

So, we can find the sum(s_n+1) by adding n to sum(s_n) if n is a multiple of 3 or 5.

If we define a function recursively, we can memoize and call S_1000 once. However, this would be no different from creating a for-each loop from 1 to 999 and adding each integer to a running total if the integer is a multiple of 3 or 5.

Let us go back to s_1000. Each multiple of 3 in s_1000 can be expressed as 3*n (n is a natural number less than 1000 / 3) and each multiple of 5 can be expressed as 5*m (m is a natural number less than 1000 / 5). Given this thinking, let us define two more sets: s3_i and s5_i where s3_i is a the set of all multiples of 3 less than i and s5_i is the set of all multiples of 5 less than i. Note: s3_i = {3*j | for all j < i/3} and s5_i = {5*j | for all j < i/5} and s3_i U s5_i = s_i. Therefore sum(s3_i) + sum(s5_i) - sum(s3_i /^\ s5_i) = S_i. By looking at the set-builder notation definition of s3_i, sum(s3_i) is clearly equal to 3*sum({j | for all j < i/3}) and, similarly, sum(s5_i) is clearly equal to 5*sum({j | for all j < i/5}). sum({j | for all j < i/3}) = 1+2+3+...+floor(i/3) (a similar form for the other sum).
